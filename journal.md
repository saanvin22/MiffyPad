# August 12th: Got my case and built the pad

I finally got the case and set to assembling my Miffypad. I started by soldering the switches and LEDs first, and then the Xiao. Here, I noticed that the pins on the xiao caused the pcb
board to tilt when I placed the case, so using pliers, I bent the pins in the back, and that fixed the issue. Then I put the PCB in the case and attached the screws and nuts. I wanted to make it removable as I'll be getting a 
3D printer and I wanted to try to make different cases for the hackpad in the future. Then I added the keycaps and uploaded the code, and I was good to go.
